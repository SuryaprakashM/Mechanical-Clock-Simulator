# Mechanical-Clock-Simulator
“Mechanical Clock Simulator” is an openGL implemented simulation of internal working, as well as the external working of a mechanical clock. A mechanical Clock is a clock that works using mechanical energy. In a mechanical clock, the wouding coil is first rotated. The energy obtained from this mechanical energy generated is then used to rotate the gears inside the clock.

This “Mechanical Clock Simulator” provides an interactive interface to the user. User can set a desired time. The simulator indicates the time set by the user and starts working from then. The user can transit between the internal working, that is, the user can see the gears movements, and he can also see the external working, that is, the clock face, using the keyboard.
